This mod improves the models used for Republic soldier and TSF officer armor. Texture mapping errors on the male model are corrected, and the female model is replaced with a higher-quality one based on the male model.


# Installation

1. Copy all files from the Override folder to your game's Override folder. If you do not already have an Override folder, make one.


# Uninstallation

1. Remove all installed files.


# Compatibility

This mod changes the texture mapping of the female Republic and TSF armor model to be the same as the male model. That means this mod will not be compatible with mods which edit the **female** textures, `N_RepSold_F01` and `N_TSFOff_F01`, but it will be compatible with mods which edit the **male** textures, `N_RepSold01` and `N_TSFOff01`, and those can be applied to all Republic and TSF armors regardless of gender. Replace this mod's `N_RepSold_F01.tpc` and `N_TSFOff_F01.tpc` files with copies of the other mod's `N_RepSold01` and `N_TSFOff01` textures, respectively.
